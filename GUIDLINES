	The primary purpose of this project is to provide a complete working
example of Yii's components. Because there are many aspects of Yii providing
a clear and explicit code is the biggest concern. This file is intended to
provide the basic guidlines for creating examples to be included in this
project. However, these guidlines are subject to change as more features are
added so please review them before submitting a pull request.

	One controller per example.

	Model names should include the controller name that uses them.

		For example if the controller is BlogController, the models
		should be BlogPost, BlogUser, BlogCommand etc.

	Database tables should include the controller name that uses them.
	(same as the above example but _'s are acceptable for seperation).

		For example if the controller is BlogController, the table
		names shoule be blog_post, blog_user, blog_command.

	No short variable names unless its obvious what the variable is used
	for (subject to interpretation, if in doubt, be explicit).

		For example: for ($i; $i < $someValue; $i++) $i here is
		accaptable.  However, in $m=new MyModel; $m here is not.
