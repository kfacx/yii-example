Complete Yii Example
====================

	The goal of this project is to have a completely installed and
running example site built using Yii. This example aims to cover as many
aspects of Yii as possible. Some of the examples will cover:

	DB Migrations

	Unit Tests

	Modules

	Behaviours

	JavaScript interaction with Yii's JavaScript objects

	Provide framework for using extention and vendor add-ons development
	and testing.

	Use of PHP's Namespace


Requirements:

	A working install of Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com/)

	Capistrano (http://www.capistranorb.com/)

	A computer with at least 2GB of ram


Recomended:

	A fast internet connection to download the Debian Vagrant box. (The
	file is 564MB)

	A computer with at least 4GB ram.


Install:

	These install steps assume the host system is unix based (Linux, Mac
OSX, *BSD, etc.).

	You will need to add the following line to your local /etc/hosts

	192.168.42.101 yii-example.local.domain yii-example yii-demo-blog yii-demo-hangman yii-demo-helloworld yii-demo-phonebook

	Then run the following commands:

		git clone https://github.com/kfacx/yii-example.git

		cd yii-example

		vagrant up

		chmod 0600 vagrant_insecure_key

		cap deploy:setup

		cap deploy

	The 'vagrant up' can take a long time to finish. If you have a slow
internet connection it can take hours to download the base box.

	Once complete, the sites can be tested with the following urls:

	http://yii-example/
	http://yii-demo-blog/
	http://yii-demo-hangman/
	http://yii-demo-helloworld/
	http://yii-demo-phonebook/


Development:

	If you intend to use this project for personal development or to add
to the project, seeing the results is easy and fast. Simply edit the
files then run:

	cap deploy

	If all the unit tests pass then the site is now updated on the VM.

Enjoy!
